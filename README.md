# Nomenclaturize 2

An inventory / Bill of materials manager. Based on Svelte, SvelteKit & Pocketbase.

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will run pocketbase alongside the Vite dev server.
